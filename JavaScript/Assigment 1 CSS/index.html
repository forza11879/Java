          <h3>About CPE-Riverview Daycare Education:</h3>
         
          <p>
            In our CPE-Riverview Daycare classrooms, children begin experiencing learning
            through a "hands-on” manner at the age of two and are reintroduced
            several times during the following years at increasing degrees of
            abstraction and complexity. Children are encouraged to explore their
            environment, to follow natural impulses in discovering how things work,
            do their own research and to express themselves. Education of character
            is considered equally with academic education. Children learn to take
            care of themselves, their environment and each other. They participate
            in cooking, cleaning, building, gardening, moving gracefully, speaking
            politely, being considerate and helpful and doing service for the community.
          </p>

          <p>The environment is arranged according to subject areas, and children are always
          free to move around the room instead of sitting at desks. There is no limit to how 
          long a child can work with a piece of material. At any one time in a day all subjects
          - math, language, science, geography, art, music, etc...will be being studied at all levels.</p>

          <p>
            The CPE-Riverview Daycare materials teach specific things and then the creativity is incredible.
            Like learning to handle a good violin and then playing music. It is not considered "creative"
            to use a violin as a hammer or a bridge when playing with blocks. We consider it "creative"
            to learn how to use the violin properly and then create music. The same goes for the materials
            in a CPE-Riverview Daycare classroom.</p>
